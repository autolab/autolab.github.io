# Autolab Blog

This is the source of the blog for the Autolab Project. We're using Jekyll and
Octopress 3.


## Installation

Make sure you have a recent version of Ruby installed and run

```console
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```

Once you've done that, you can preview the site locally by running

```console
$ jekyll serve --drafts
```


## Usage

Documentation is written as Jekyll drafts. To read them, either fire up the
Jekyll server with `jekyll serve --drafts` or just open up these files:
`_drafts/docs-*.markdown`.

The documentation is split into three files:

- __Kitchen Sink__
  - Contains a reference of the types of Markdown extensions you can use in this
    blog.
- __Jekyll and Octopress Tips__
  - This is a good read for those new to Jekyll or Octopress.
- __Markdown Style Guide__
  - Please read this and write clean Markdown.
